militech are such fucking gonks they can't even backtrace a ten-year-old crawling in their datafiles. had to skim eddies from a black fund operated by something called the FIA,

chipping away at bartmoss. if i can crack whatever is in here, then songbird should be no problem. he knew an insane amount about the net, like

had my first real scare with the blackwall. poked too far into a repository for a RABIDS virus and just felt... floating, as though the slice of the net i was in
was just a lilypad floating on top of a lake. almost like the net i knew was only the head of a pin compared to what was really out there--they said that the 
old net was massive in comparison to ours, but this is approaching absurdity. felt the blackwall, too--if i was a frog realizing how big the lake i lived in was,
the blackwall was the lilypad i sat on. there's something in the water.

dug some more. maintaining the metaphor, the frog on the lilypad looked down into the water--saw what felt like faces upon faces of nameless gods, a ravenous swarm of code that
fought both itself and the blackwall, almost as though it could smell me so close to it. they talk, too. not necessarily with vocal chords--ganic concept--but it was almost as if
they held up signs with words on them. 'lilith comes,' 'join us,' 'come and see,' all sort of things like some pre-crash religion. staring into the face of rogue ais is still
scary, but for a different reason than what they told me growing up--instead of fear of the damage they can cause, i'm more afraid of how much they remind me of people, not bots. creepieee
